- The platform has 
  - backend to persist user data, like account, connected social networks (direct links) and generated QR codes.
  - web frontend to show user's landing page with all linked social network accounts.
  - mobile application to have an easy access to your personal account and be able to add / delete / update links within QR code generation.
